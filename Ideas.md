## Ideas:

### 1. Trigger on successive 3 times eye blinking 

- If the user blinks their eyes 3 times in succession, then the app skips to the next video.

- This idea would increase the functionality of the app by giving the user more functions that are easily accessible. Blinking your eyes 3 times doesn't naturally happen, but users can remember the command and execute it quickly. 

- The potential use case for this feature is in a dedicated media player, which requires simple commands that the user can use to interact with the video. 

### 2. Add functionality when eyes are not detected for a long period

- Perhaps turn off until motion is detected or something of this sort that would give more control over the possible scenarios that could occur.

- A use case would be to automatically go into power saving mode while the user is not watching video and doing something else.

### 3. Add a range of sensitivities that can be set by the user 

- Since at times it may be hard to determine if the user actually wishes for the feature to be actuated, it may be a good idea to make it easily adjustable to their liking rather than just having two options, fast and accurate.

- I think a possible use case would be when someone may squint or may have problems with the detection of their eyes. 


### 4. Add functionality for users with glasses 

- Since some users cannot actually watch videos without a pair of glasses, due to one issue or the other, I think it would be great to be able to bypass user glasses or any physical obstruction.

- A possible use case would be to display a friendly error when glasses or any other obstruction is detected, or add another motion functionality specially for users with glasses. 

### 5. Add functionality for taking screenshots

- Adding some functionality to take screenshot inside the app without using hands in any way, just using expressions or blinking five times in a row

- Possible use case would be that people can take screenshots without using hands through the app.
### 6.MAKE SMART ALARM FOR LAZY PEOPLE
-Adding a feature to alarm that when the person opens his eyes only ,the alarm will stop.
Else alarm will continue until the person awake and show his eyes to the smart alarm.
